ABSTRACT

Aims. We present the splashback radius analysis of the Adaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered Objects (AMICO) galaxy cluster
sample in the fourth data release of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS). The sample contains 9049 rich galaxy clusters within z ∈ [0.1, 0.8],
with shear measurements available for 8730 of them.
Methods. We measure and model the stacked reduced shear, gt, and the cluster-galaxy correlation function, wcg, in bins of observed
intrinsic richness, λ∗, and redshift, z. Building on the methods employed in recent cosmological analyses, we model the average
splashback radius, rsp, of the underlying dark matter halo distribution, accounting for the known systematic uncertainties affecting
measurements and theoretical models.
Results. By modelling gt and wcg separately, in the cluster-centric radial range R ∈ [0.4, 5] h−1Mpc, we constrain rsp, the mass
accretion rate, Γ, and the relation between Rsp ≡ rsp/r200m and the peak height, ν200m, over the mass range M200m ∈ [0.4, 20] 1014h−1M⊙.
The two probes provide consistent results that also agree with Λ-cold dark matter model predictions. Our Rsp constraints are consistent
with those from previous observations. For gt and wcg, we achieve a precision of 14% and 10% per cluster stack, respectively.
The higher precision of wcg, enabled by its combination with weak-lensing constraints on the mass-richness relation, highlights the
complementarity of lensing and clustering in measuring rsp and constraining the properties of the infalling material region.

1. Introduction

The mass profiles of dark matter haloes have been exten-
sively investigated using N-body simulations (see e.g. Einasto
1965; Navarro, Frenk, & White 1997; Baltz, Marshall, & Oguri
2009), establishing a robust theoretical foundation for interpret-
ing galaxy cluster observations. Precise measurements of the in-
ner and virialised regions of clusters not only support cosmo-
logical analyses based on cluster statistics (Planck Collaboration
XXIV 2016; Costanzi et al. 2019; Marulli et al. 2021; Romanello
et al. 2024; Seppi et al. 2024; Ghirardini et al. 2024; Lesci
et al. 2025), but also enable tests of gravity theories (Pizzuti
et al. 2017; Cardone et al. 2021; Mitchell et al. 2021; Rosselli
et al. 2023) and constraints on dark matter self-interactions (Pe-
ter et al. 2013; Robertson et al. 2019; Eckert et al. 2022; Bhat-
tacharyya et al. 2022; Despali et al. 2025). In addition, mea-
surements in the outer halo regime, commonly referred to as
the two-halo region and dominant beyond 2–5 Mpc from clus-

ter centres (Tinker et al. 2005), offer a complementary route to
constrain cosmological parameters and cluster masses (Covone
et al. 2014; Sereno et al. 2018; Giocoli et al. 2021; Ingoglia et al.
2022; Eltvedt et al. 2024).

In the transition between the virialised region and the two-
halo regime, a sharp steepening in the density profile is expected.
This feature, located in the proximity of the splashback radius,
rsp, was initially predicted from analytical models of spheri-
cal secondary collapse by Fillmore & Goldreich (1984) and
Bertschinger (1985), and then robustly identified in dark mat-
ter simulations (Diemer & Kravtsov 2014; Adhikari et al. 2014;
More et al. 2015). The splashback radius marks the apocentre of
the first orbit of recently accreted material and, in turn, it strongly
depends on the mass accretion rate, Γ. At fixed mass, haloes
with higher Γ exhibit smaller rsp due to the deepening of the
gravitational potential well during the orbit of infalling material.
More massive subhaloes also tend to have a smaller orbit apoc-
entre than the less massive ones, an effect attributed to dynami-
cal friction (Diemer et al. 2017; Chang et al. 2018), which slows
down satellites by dissipating kinetic energy, thereby bringing

them deeper into the potential well. Unlike halo concentration,
the location of rsp is more sensitive to recent accretion (within
the last crossing time) than to the entire assembly history (Shin
& Diemer 2023). However, the depth and width of the associ-
ated density steepening are strongly influenced by the full halo
assembly history, providing complementary information on the
location of the splashback radius (Yu et al. 2025).

As rsp delineates a boundary between first-infalling matter
and matter that has completed at least one passage through the
central region of the halo, the mass enclosed within rsp comprises
all material accreted by a given redshift, z. Therefore, this mass
definition remains unaffected by pseudo-evolution (More et al.
2015) and can potentially lead to the derivation of universal halo
mass function models (Diemer 2020b; Ryu & Lee 2021, 2022).
In fact, recent studies highlight the distinction between orbiting
and infalling particles as the key factor in the definition of a halo
(see Vladimir et al. 2025, and references therein). Furthermore,
rsp has been shown to correlate with fundamental cosmological
parameters, such as the matter density parameter at z = 0, Ωm,
and the square root of the mass variance on a scale of 8 h−1Mpc
at z = 0, σ8 (Diemer et al. 2017; Haggar et al. 2024; Mpetha
et al. 2024).

It is critical to note that the physical origin of rsp lies in the
dynamics of halo particles. Diemer (2017, 2020a) showed that
the radius of the steepest slope, which is directly observable in
the mass density profiles, is a scattered proxy of rsp (see also
Sun et al. 2025). This occurs because the apocentres are dis-
tributed across a wide radial range due to non-spherical halo
shapes, complex accretion histories, and gravitational interac-
tions with neighbouring haloes. Alternative halo boundary defi-
nitions have been proposed in the literature, such as the depletion
radius (Fong & Han 2021; Zhou & Han 2023), which is about 2
times larger than rsp and corresponds to the scale above which
the matter density decreases with time. Pizzardo et al. (2024)
demonstrated that the inflection point in the radial velocity pro-
file of cluster galaxies agrees with rsp within 1σ, establishing
an additional connection between the splashback radius and the
inner boundary of the cluster infall region. García et al. (2023)
and Salazar et al. (2025) showed that a clear truncation radius is
apparent in the halo–matter correlation function, when particles
are classified as bound or infalling based on their phase-space
trajectories and accretion history.

In this work, following standard nomenclature in the liter-
ature, we define the radius of steepest slope as the splashback
radius. We constrained the splashback radii of the galaxy clus-
ters detected with the Adaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered
Objects (AMICO, Bellagamba et al. 2018; Maturi et al. 2019)
in the fourth data release of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-
1000, Kuijken et al. 2019). The cluster sample used in this work
comprises 8730 rich clusters, spanning a total mass range of
M200m ∈ [0.4, 20] 1014h−1M⊙ and extending up to a redshift
z = 0.8. We measured and modelled the stacked weak-lensing
profiles and cluster-galaxy correlation function of ensembles of
clusters, constraining the relation between the peak height, ν200m,
and the normalised splashback radius, Rsp ≡ rsp/r200m, where
r200m is the radius enclosing a mass M200m, such that the corre-
sponding mean density is 200 times the mean density of the Uni-
verse at the halo redshift. We also derived the mass accretion rate
as a function of mass and redshift. Our results are competitive, in
terms of statistical uncertainties, with those from previous anal-
yses of observed cluster samples (More et al. 2016; Baxter et al.
2017; Umetsu & Diemer 2017; Chang et al. 2018; Contigiani
et al. 2019; Zürcher & More 2019; Shin et al. 2019; Murata
et al. 2020; Bianconi et al. 2021; Shin et al. 2021; Rana et al.

2023; Joshi et al. 2025). Compared to the analogous analysis by
Giocoli et al. (2024), based on AMICO detections in the third
data release of KiDS (KiDS-DR3, de Jong et al. 2017), we em-
ployed more conservative galaxy and cluster selections, and used
a more extensive modelling of systematic uncertainties. Never-
theless, we achieve a comparable precision on the splashback
radius to Giocoli et al. (2024), since the survey effective area is
more than doubled compared to KiDS-DR3, and the cluster sam-
ple extends up to larger redshifts.

The paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2 we present the
galaxy cluster and shear samples, while in Sect. 3 the measure-
ments of stacked weak-lensing profiles and cluster-galaxy corre-
lation function are presented. In Sect. 4, we outline the theoreti-
cal framework, likelihood function, and prior distributions used
in this work. We present our results in Sect. 5 and our conclu-
sions in Sect. 6.

In this work, we adopted a concordance flat Λ cold dark mat-
ter (ΛCDM) cosmological model. The base 10 logarithm is re-
ferred to as log, while ln represents the natural logarithm. The
statistical analyses presented in this paper were performed using
the CosmoBolognaLib1 (CBL, Marulli et al. 2016), a set of free
software C++/Python numerical libraries for cosmological cal-
culations. The linear matter power spectrum is computed with
CAMB2 (Lewis & Challinor 2011).

2. Data set

In our analysis we used KiDS-1000 data (Kuijken et al. 2019),
which are based on imaging obtained with the OmegaCAM
wide-field camera (Kuijken 2011), operating on the VLT Sur-
vey Telescope (VST, Capaccioli & Schipani 2011). The KiDS-
1000 release comprises 1006 square-degree tiles, each spanning
roughly 1 deg2. It includes 2 arcsecond aperture photometry in
the u, g, r, and i optical bands, with 5σ depth limits of 24.23,
25.12, 25.02, and 23.68 magnitudes, respectively. Complemen-
tary near-infrared photometry in the Z, Y, J, H, and Ks bands is
also provided by the VISTA Kilo-degree INfrared Galaxy survey
(VIKING, Edge et al. 2013; Sutherland et al. 2015), which fully
overlaps the KiDS footprint.

The galaxy cluster sample analysed in this work originates
from the AMICO KiDS-1000 catalogue (Maturi et al. 2025, M25
hereafter), constructed by applying the AMICO algorithm (Bel-
lagamba et al. 2018; Maturi et al. 2019) to KiDS-1000 photo-
metric data. AMICO uses an optimal matched filter and is one
of the official cluster-finding tools of the Euclid mission (Eu-
clid Collaboration: Adam et al. 2019). The catalogue excludes
regions affected by image artefacts and photometric issues, re-
sulting in a clean survey area of 839 deg2, with cluster detec-
tions up to z = 0.9. Following Lesci et al. (2025, L25 hereafter),
we restricted our analysis to clusters with S/N > 3.5 and red-
shifts z ∈ [0.1, 0.8], yielding 22 396 detections. Additional cuts
in the cluster mass proxy, namely the intrinsic richness λ∗ (see
M25), yield a final cluster sample of 8730 objects, as discussed
in Sect. 3. These selections optimise the trade-off between fit
quality and sample size (L25). Cluster redshifts have been cor-
rected for the bias identified by M25, based on a comparison
with spectroscopic redshifts available within the KiDS data set
(collectively referred to as KiDZ, van den Busch et al. 2020,
2022). These spectroscopic redshifts come from the Galaxy and
Mass Assembly survey data release 4 (GAMA-DR4, Driver et al.
2011; Liske et al. 2015; Driver et al. 2022), the Sloan Digital Sky

Survey (SDSS, Alam et al. 2015), and the 2-degree Field Lens-
ing Survey (2dFLens, Blake et al. 2016). Each AMICO cluster
has been assigned a bias-corrected redshift, with a resulting pre-
cision of σz/(1 + z) = 0.014. The left panel of Fig. 1 displays the
comparison of measured and debiased AMICO cluster redshift
distributions.

As in Kuijken et al. (2019), M25 employed the Bayesian
Photometric Redshift (BPZ, Benítez 2000) code to estimate
galaxy photometric redshifts for cluster detection. The prior on
redshift probabilities used in Kuijken et al. (2019) was opti-
mised for the weak-lensing analysis, reducing uncertainties and
catastrophic outliers for faint, high-redshift galaxies. However,
it introduced a significant bias for bright, low-redshift galaxies,
which are important for cluster detection. For this reason, M25
adopted instead the redshift prior used in the KiDS-DR3 analysis
(de Jong et al. 2017). This choice results in a galaxy photometric
redshift (photo-z) uncertainty of σz,g/(1 + z) = 0.074 for galaxies
with r < 23, consistent with the findings of Kuijken et al. (2019).
In the present work, we used photometric redshifts derived fol-
lowing this approach.

To measure the weak-lensing profiles of AMICO galaxy
clusters, we utilised the KiDS-1000 gold shear catalogue
(Wright et al. 2020; Hildebrandt et al. 2021; Giblin et al. 2021).
This data set contains approximately 21 million galaxies across
an effective area of 777 deg2, with a weighted effective num-
ber density of ngold
eff = 6.17 arcmin−2. Shape measurements are
based on the deep KiDS r-band imaging, and shear estimates are
derived by employing the lensfit algorithm (Miller et al. 2007;
Fenech Conti et al. 2017). Following Hildebrandt et al. (2021),
we considere galaxies having redshift in the range zg ∈ [0.1, 1.2].
We used the same galaxy catalogue to measure the cluster-galaxy
correlation function (Sect. 3.2). To ensure spatial matching, we
restricted the cluster sample to the footprint of the galaxy sam-
ple, since the latter has a smaller effective area. For correlation
function measurements, we also applied the r < 24 magnitude
cut, corresponding to the depth of the shallowest survey tile, to
ensure homogeneity of the angular galaxy distribution (follow-
ing M25).

Following Hildebrandt et al. (2021), we reconstructed galaxy
redshift distributions using self-organising maps (SOM; Koho-
nen 1982; Wright et al. 2020). We did not use the galaxy red-
shift distributions from Hildebrandt et al. (2021), as our anal-
ysis adopts a different photo-z estimation method and a differ-
ent binning strategy. Instead, we applied SOM to the spectro-
scopic sample from van den Busch et al. (2022) and extended
by Wright et al. (2024), comprising 93 224 galaxies. While M25

used a different method to estimate the unbiased cluster redshift
distribution compared to the SOM-based approach we applied
to galaxies, we do not expect this to introduce systematics. In-
deed, as discussed in the following, our analysis accounts for
the statistical uncertainties of both the galaxy and cluster red-
shift distributions. We employed the SOM algorithm introduced
by Wright et al. (2020) and subsequently implemented by Hilde-
brandt et al. (2021) for KiDS-1000 redshift distribution calibra-
tion, based on the kohonen code (Wehrens & Buydens 2007;
Wehrens & Kruisselbrink 2018). Following Wright et al. (2020)
and L25, we provided the SOM algorithm with photometric data
from all 9 KiDS and VIKING bands, including their full colour
space combinations. The SOM architecture employs a toroidal
topology with a 50×50 hexagonal grid. The middle panel in Fig.
1 shows the observed distribution of the full galaxy sample as
a function of galaxy redshift, zg, along with the correspond-
ing SOM-reconstructed distribution. The latter was employed
in the cluster-galaxy correlation function modelling. The right
panel of Fig. 1 displays three representative SOM-reconstructed
background galaxy redshift distributions, each conditioned on
a different cluster redshift. These distributions are measured in
cluster redshift bins having a width of δz = 0.05 and spanning
the full sample range, based on a combination of colour and
photo-z background selections (for details, we refer to L25). We
used these reconstructed background redshift distributions in the
weak-lensing modelling.

3. Measurements

In this section, we present the measurements of stacked cluster
lensing (Sect. 3.1) and cluster-galaxy correlation function (Sect.
3.2). The lensing measurement pipeline follows that of L25, who
carried out the mass calibration of the cluster sample analysed in
this work. The properties of the cluster subsamples are reported
in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2 of L25, these cluster subsam-
ples have a purity ranging from 97% to 100%. Consistent with
L25, for all profile measurements we adopted a flat ΛCDM cos-
mology with a Hubble constant of H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1 and
Ωm = 0.3. Throughout this paper, we considered different Ωm
values to model our measurements. For the mass probe measure-
ments considered in this work, cosmological dependence arises
solely from the conversion to cluster-centric physical distances.
As discussed in Sect. 4.4, we modelled the geometric distortions
introduced by these assumptions.

Notes. The bins of observed cluster photo-z, zob, and intrinsic richness, λ∗
ob, are shown in the first and second columns, respectively. The third
column lists the number of clusters used for the measurements, while the fourth and fifth columns report the median cluster redshift and richness,
respectively. In the subsequent columns, we show the posteriors on the mean mass, ⟨Mgt
200m⟩ (in units of 1014h−1M⊙), splashback radius, ⟨rsp⟩ (in
h−1Mpc), normalised splashback radius, ⟨Rsp⟩ ≡ ⟨rsp/r200m⟩, and mass accretion rate, ⟨Γ⟩. The latter is dimensionless (see Eq. 45). The gt and wcg
superscripts represent the results from weak lensing and cluster-galaxy correlation function, respectively.

3.1. Stacked weak-lensing profiles

The tangential shear, γt, is related to the excess surface density,
∆Σt, through the following relation (see e.g. Sheldon et al. 2004):

∆Σt(R) = Σ(< R) − Σ(R) = Σcritγt(R),
where Σ(R) denotes the surface mass density at radius R, Σ(< R)
is its mean enclosed within the radius R, and Σcrit is the critical
surface density, which is expressed as (Bartelmann & Schneider
2001)

where c is the speed of light, G is Newton’s gravitational con-
stant, while Ds, Dl, and Dls are the observer-source, observer-
lens, and lens-source angular diameter distances, respectively.

The weak-lensing observable linked to galaxy ellipticities is
the reduced shear, namely g = γ/(1 − κ), where κ ≡ Σ/Σcrit is
the convergence (Schneider & Seitz 1995). We estimated the re-
duced tangential shear profile, gt, of a cluster labelled as k as (see
e.g. Viola et al. 2015):
(cid:32) (cid:80)

(cid:33)

,

(3)

gt,k(R j) =

i∈ j wi et,i
(cid:80)
i∈ j wi

1
1 + M j

where et,i is the tangential component of the ellipticity of the ith
background galaxy, j is the radial annulus index, with an asso-
ciated average projected radius R j, corresponding to the central
value of the radial bin. The impact of this radial point definition
on our results is expected to be negligible. Indeed, L25 demon-
strated that for our sample, alternative estimates of the effective
radius differ from R j by only 0.1%. In addition, wi is the statisti-
cal weight assigned to the measure of the source ellipticity of the
ith background galaxy (Sheldon et al. 2004), while M j denotes
the average multiplicative shear bias, defined as

M j =

(cid:80)

i∈ j wi mi
(cid:80)
i∈ j wi

,

(4)

where mi is the multiplicative shear bias of the ith background
galaxy. Following L25, for each background source we draw a

Article number, page 4 of 17

value of m from a uniform distribution in the range [−2σm, 2σm],
where σm = 0.02 corresponds to the largest 1σ interval of the
m distributions obtained by Giblin et al. (2021). We used this
approximation because the m estimates by Giblin et al. (2021)
were derived from redshift distributions that do not correspond
to those considered in this work. The statistical uncertainty on m,
σm, is propagated into the final results by including it in the co-
variance matrix (see Sect. 4.6). We neglected the shear additive
bias term, because Giblin et al. (2021) constrained it to be 10−4,
which is an order of magnitude smaller than our stacked gt uncer-
tainties. The background galaxy samples are defined through the
combination of the photo-z and colour selections defined in L25.
In the modelling described in Sect. 4, we used the background
redshift distributions reconstructed through SOM, as described
in Sect. 2.

The stacked reduced shear profile in the pth bin of observed
ob,p, and in the qth bin of observed cluster

intrinsic richness, ∆λ∗
redshift, ∆zob,q, is expressed as

gt(R j, ∆λ∗

ob,p, ∆zob,q) =

(cid:80)

k∈∆λ∗
(cid:80)

ob,p,∆zob,q Wk, j gt,k(R j)
ob,p,∆zob,q Wk, j
k∈∆λ∗

,

(5)

where gt,k is given by Eq. (3), k runs over all clusters falling in
the bins of λ∗ and z, while Wk, j is the total weight for the jth
radial bin of the kth cluster, estimated as
Wk, j =

wi ,

(cid:88)

(6)

i∈ j

where i runs over the background galaxies in the jth radial bin.
We used the same λ∗ and z bins as L25, shown in Table 1. This
λ∗ and z selection yields a sample of 9049 clusters, which re-
duce to 8730 due to the smaller area covered by the shear sam-
ple compared to the cluster sample (see Sect. 2). We adopted the
same minimum cluster-centric projected distance of 400 h−1kpc
as L25, but extended the maximum radius to 5 h−1Mpc in order
to include measurements of the infalling region of galaxy clus-
ters. Ten logarithmically spaced radial bins are used.

The bootstrap-estimated covariance matrix for each stacked
gt(R) measurement derives from 10 000 resamplings of the
cluster profiles within the stack. This covariance estimate in-
corporates the intrinsic scatter in the observable-mass and

G. F. Lesci et al.: AMICO clusters in KiDS-1000: Splashback radius

concentration-mass relations, along with miscentring effects and
the contribution from the large-scale structure, though it does not
account for the covariance due to background galaxies shared be-
tween clusters. However, as demonstrated by McClintock et al.
(2019), for Stage-III surveys such shared-source contributions
remain subdominant to shape noise and large-scale structure ef-
fects. Finally, we neglected the covariance across different red-
shift and richness bins, as its impact has been shown to be negli-
gible in Stage-III surveys (McClintock et al. 2019).

3.2. Cluster-galaxy correlation function

The projected cluster-galaxy correlation function, denoted as
wcg, in the pth bin of intrinsic richness, ∆λ∗
ob,p, and in the qth bin
of cluster redshift, ∆zob,q, is measured using the Landy-Szalay
estimator (Landy & Szalay 1993), expressed as follows:

wcg(R j, ∆λ∗

ob,p, ∆zob,q) =

DcDg(R j) − DcRg(R j) − RcDg(R j)
RcRg(R j)

+1 .

(7)

Compared to the Davis-Peebles estimator (Davis & Peebles
1983), Eq. (7) reduces variance and edge effects. In Eq. (7), R j
is the central point of the jth radial annulus, while DcDg(R j),
DcRg(R j), RcDg(R j), and RcRg(R j) are the normalised data clus-
ter - data galaxy, data cluster - random galaxy, random cluster -
data galaxy, random cluster - random galaxy pairs, respectively.
In Eq. (7), we adopted the same R j points used for weak-lensing
measurements.

To measure wcg, we used the complete KiDS-1000 gold shear
catalogue, imposing the magnitude cut r < 24 (see Sect. 2). As
this cut corresponds to the depth of the shallowest tile, it ensures
a homogeneous angular galaxy distribution. Furthermore, in Eq.
(7), for each cluster we include all galaxies at a projected sepa-
ration R j along the line of sight. As a result the wcg estimator is
independent of cluster membership modelling. The wcg model is
defined consistently with this approach (see Sect. 4.3).

We constructed random cluster and random galaxy samples
80 times larger than the observed ones. The extraction of ran-
dom (R.A., Dec) pairs accounts for the KiDS survey angular
mask. We assigned random cluster redshifts by reshuffling the
observed mean redshifts, which were subsequently used to de-
fine cluster-centric radial bins. For the random galaxy sample,
no redshift information is required since galaxy redshifts do not
enter the wcg estimator (Eq. 7). The adopted cluster λ∗, z, and
R bins are those used for the weak-lensing measurements pre-
sented in Sect. 3.1. Jackknife resampling was used to estimate
the covariance matrix, with KiDS tiles defining the resampling
regions. As in Sect. 3.1, we neglected the correlation between λ∗
and z bins.

4. Modelling

4.1. 3D model for individual haloes

This section presents the theoretical description of individual
three-dimensional (3D) mass profiles. The models for gt and wcg
are presented in Sects. 4.2 and 4.3, respectively, while the corre-
sponding expected values for ensembles of clusters are detailed
in Sect. 4.4. For single clusters, we characterised the 3D mass
distribution using a Diemer & Kravtsov (2014, DK14) profile,
commonly adopted to model observational data (Baxter et al.
2017; Rana et al. 2023; Giocoli et al. 2024; Joshi et al. 2025).

The corresponding excess 3D density profile is expressed as fol-
lows:

∆ρ(r) = ρs exp

Equation (8) an Einasto (1965) profile multiplied by the transi-
tion factor, ftrans. Here, the dependency of ∆ρ on M200m and z is
not explicitly shown for brevity. In Eq. (8), ρs is the characteristic
density and rs is the scale radius, expressed as rs = r200m/c200m,
where c200m is the halo concentration. As detailed in Sect. 4.4,
we modelled c200m via a log-linear scaling relation with M200m
and redshift, with the amplitude empirically constrained by our
data. For the inner slope of the Einasto profile, we assumed α =
0.155 + 0.0095ν2
c(z)/σ2(Mvir)
vir (Gao et al. 2008). Here, ν2
represents the peak height of the virial halo mass, namely Mvir,
while δc(z) is the linear theory critical overdensity required for
spherical collapse divided by the growth factor, and σ2(Mvir)
is the mass variance. For the virial overdensity definition, we
adopted the fitting function by Bryan & Norman (1998). To be
consistent with the α definition by Gao et al. (2008), we con-
verted M200m into Mvir assuming a Navarro, Frenk, & White
(1997, NFW) profile. Furthermore, we note that by treating c200m
as a free parameter, any possible systematic errors arising from
the assumptions on α are mitigated.

= δ2

vir

The Einasto profile in Eq. (8) is multiplied by a transition fac-
tor, ftrans (defined in Eq. 9), which smoothly connects the inner
halo component to the external large-scale term, namely ρouter
(defined in Eq. 10). The transition factor depends on the trunca-
tion radius, rt = Ftr200m, where Ft is the truncation factor, on
β, defining the sharpness of the transition from the 1-halo to the
outer profile, and on γ, describing the steepness of the profile at
r ∼ r200m. We expressed γ as γ = γ0νvir, following DK14. Fur-
thermore, as discussed in Sect. 4.6, we assumed Gaussian priors
on Ft, β, and γ0.

Equation (10) models the matter density distribution at r >
r200m, and it is expressed as a power-law multiplying the mean
background density of the Universe, ρm. Following the DK14
prescription, we defined the pivot radius as 5 times r200m. The
parameters be and se characterise the amplitude and slope of the
outer profile, respectively, and are treated as free parameters in
our analysis. In simulations, both the bias parameter, be, and the
slope, se, exhibit a mild dependence on the peak height (Diemer
& Kravtsov 2014). While se shows only a weak redshift evolu-
tion, this dependence is somewhat stronger for be. Thus, in our
modelling, we allowed be to vary as a function of redshift, as-
suming the following expression:

be = be,0

(cid:34)

1 + z
1 + zpiv

(cid:35)be,z

.

(11)

where zpiv = 0.4. We note that, differently from the DK14
functional form, Eq. (10) does not include ρm as an additive
term. In fact, the mass profile probes considered in this study,
namely weak lensing and correlation function, measure the
excess of mass compared to the background. On the other hand,
as detailed in Sect. 4.5, the ρm contribution is considered in the

computation of the splashback radius. The six free parameters
describing the halo profiles (Ft, β, γ0, be,0, be,z, and se) are
summarised in the top part of Table 2.

4.2. gt model for individual haloes

The tangential reduced shear component of a halo, gt, is ex-
pressed as (Seitz & Schneider 1997)

gt(R, M, z) =

∆Σt(R, M, z) ⟨Σ−1

crit(z)⟩
crit(z)⟩−1 ⟨Σ−2

crit(z)⟩

1 − Σ(R, M, z) ⟨Σ−1

,

(12)

where R is the projected radius, Σ is the surface mass density,
obtained by integrating Eq. (8) as

galaxy at zg and a cluster at z, given a projected cluster-centric
distance R, expressed as follows:

(cid:115)

f (R, zg, z) =

R2 +

(cid:34) χ(zg) − χ(z)
1 + z

(cid:35)2

,

(18)

where χ is the comoving distance. Furthermore, bg in Eq. (17)
is the galaxy bias, treated as independent of R (see Appendix
B). As discussed in Sects. 4.4 and 4.6, we did not model the
bg dependence on the true halo mass and redshift. Instead, for
each stack of clusters defined in bins of observed intrinsic rich-
ness λ∗
ob and cluster redshift zob, we introduced the average bias
⟨bg(∆λ∗
ob, ∆zob)⟩ as a free parameter. We did not model miscen-
tring in Eq. (17) because it primarily affects mass estimates.
Since we adopted the mass posteriors from the gt analysis as pri-
ors for the wcg modelling (see Sect. 4.6), this effect is inherently
accounted for in our approach.

where η = 1, 2, Σcrit is given by Eq. (2), zg is the galaxy redshift,
while n(zg | z) is the normalised true background redshift distri-
bution given a cluster redshift z, reconstructed through SOM
(Sect. 2). We remark that Eq. (12) describes the reduced shear
profiles of perfectly centred cluster detections. The total reduced
shear includes the contribution by miscentred clusters and is ex-
pressed as follows:

gt,tot = (1 − foff) gt + foff gt,off ,

(16)

where foff is the fraction of miscentred clusters, gt is given by
Eq. (12), while gt,off is the miscentred tangential reduced shear,
whose derivation is detailed in Appendix A.

4.3. wcg model for individual haloes

We express the 2D cluster-galaxy correlation function as follows
(see Appendix B for its derivation):

malised galaxy redshift distribution, reconstructed through SOM
and shown in the middle panel of Fig. 1 (see also Sect. 2). For
the integration in Eq. (17), we interpolated the discretised inte-
grand. In Eq. (17), f (R, zg, z) is the physical distance between a

catalogues, while Pbkg is the purity of the background galaxy
sample, derived through SOM. For details on these purity pa-
rameters, we refer to L25. In Eq. (19), ztr is the true redshift, V
is the co-moving volume, dΩ is the solid angle element, M is the
true mass, while gt,tot is given by Eq. (16) and, in order to model
geometric distortions, it is computed at the test radius Rtest,

Notes. In the first and second columns we list the symbols and descriptions of the parameters, respectively. The third and fourth columns report
the parameter priors adopted for the modelling of gt and wcg, respectively. Here, a range represents a uniform prior, while N(µ, σ) stands for a
Gaussian prior with mean µ and standard deviation σ. In the last two columns, we show the median values of the 1D marginalised posteriors, along
with the 16th and 84th percentiles. The posterior is not reported in cases where it closely aligns with the prior.

where M∗ is expressed in h−1M⊙ and log M∗ = 13.8, q and s

ness, and true intrinsic richness, respectively. P(zob|ztr) is a Gaus-
sian probability density function with mean corresponding to ztr

tr, ztr), its coefficients, and of the cluster sample com-
of P(λ∗

probability density distribution P(λ∗

rameters in our modelling (see also Table 2). Lastly, in Eq. (19),

cluster-galaxy correlation function in Eq. (17) where we impose
⟨bg(M, z)⟩ = 1, and I is the integral constraint, expressed as

where RcRg is the normalised number of random cluster - ran-

imposing I(∆λ∗
ob, ∆zob) = 0 in Eq. (28), while j runs over the
number of cluster-centric radial bins. Here, the minimum radial
scale considered is 400 h−1kpc, matching the one adopted for the
measurements (Sect. 3). The radial upper limit considered in Eq.
(30) is derived as

Rlim(z) = Dl(z) θlim ,

(31)

where Dl is the angular diameter distance, computed at the me-
dian cluster redshifts listed in Table 1, while θlim represents the
angular extension of the smallest side of the KiDS angular mask.
We remark that KiDS is divided into two stripes, with θlim = 8.5
deg on average (Kuijken et al. 2019). We adopted this θlim value
in Eq. (31), which yields Rlim ≃ 70 h−1Mpc for zob ∈ [0.1, 0.3),
Rlim ≃ 110 h−1Mpc for zob ∈ [0.3, 0.45), and Rlim ≃ 150 h−1Mpc
for zob ∈ [0.45, 0.8]. Assuming the best-fit parameters of the wcg
modelling in Eq. (30), we find that I(∆λ∗
ob, ∆zob) ≃ 10−2 in all
cluster stacks. This is the same order of magnitude as the wcg
measurements at large radii and low-to-intermediate redshifts
(see Fig. 2).

In the reduced shear and correlation function models appear-
ing in Eqs. (19) and (28), we assumed the following log-linear
model for the c200m − M200m relation:

where ∆ρ(r, M, ztr) is given by Eq. (8). Equation (36) does not
include the contribution by halo miscentring, as it affects scales
much smaller than rsp and can be therefore neglected. We eval-
uate Eq. (34) at each step of the Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC). By replacing Rsp(M, ztr) in Eq. (34) with ν200m(M, ztr),
rsp(M, ztr), or M200m, we derived the expected value of ν200m (ap-
pearing in Eq. 33), rsp, or M200m, respectively, in bins of λ∗
ob and
zob.

We emphasise that Eq. (34) removes any dependence on the
radial binning scheme. While stacking clusters as a function
of r/r200m could in principle enhance the signal-to-noise of rsp
(Diemer & Kravtsov 2014), this approach is compromised for
observational data due to noisy r200m estimates. Equation (34)
solves this issue, as it models the average profile of a recon-
structed population of dark matter haloes. Conversely, in sim-
ulations, average profiles of cluster ensembles are modelled as a
single profile, thanks to the reduced scatter on r200m.

4.6. Likelihood and priors

In this work, we analysed gt and wcg separately to compare two
independent estimates of rsp. For both these probes, we per-
formed a joint Bayesian analysis of all the cluster stacks, by
means of an MCMC algorithm. The likelihood function of a
probe is expressed as

where Mpiv and zpiv are the same as those assumed in Eq. (26). As
discussed in Sect. 4.6, log c0 is a free parameter in the analysis,
while cM and cz are fixed to the fiducial values by Duffy et al.
(2008).

constraints shall be tested in future studies. Conversely, we in-
cluded the contribution to wcg measurements due to the uncer-
tainty on the mean of the SOM-reconstructed n(zg), amount-
ing to 2% (Hildebrandt et al. 2021). To this end, we estimated
⟨wcg(R, ∆λ∗

using the reconstructed n(zg) from Sect. 2 in Eq. (17). We then
repeated this process while shifting nbkg(zg) by ±2% of its mean.
This yielded a relative uncertainty on wcg which is approximately
constant with R and λ∗
ob, amounting to 3% for the first two cluster
redshift bins and 2% for the last one. Thus, the residual system-

Gaussian priors were adopted also on the parameters of the
transition factor (Eq. 9), namely γ0, appearing in the relation
γ = γ0νvir (see Sect. 4.1), and β, both having mean 4 (following

outer profile parameters (Eq. 10), as introduced in Sect. 4.1, we
assumed that se is independent of mass and redshift, and adopted
a flat prior on this parameter. On the other hand, be varies with
redshift (Eq. 11), and flat priors are adopted for its amplitude,
be,0, and redshift scaling, be,z.

The fraction of miscentred clusters, foff, in Eq. (16) is as-
signed a Gaussian prior with mean 0.3 and standard deviation
0.1, imposing also foff > 0, while the miscentring scale, σoff,
in Eq. (A.1) is given the uniform prior [0, 0.5] h−1Mpc. These
priors are motivated by previous studies of centre offsets in sim-
ulations (Yan et al. 2020; Sommer et al. 2024) and observations
across various mass density tracers (Saro et al. 2015; Zhang et al.
2019; Seppi et al. 2023; Ding et al. 2025). In the gt modelling,
we assumed flat priors on the log λ∗ − log M200m scaling relation
parameters (Eqs. 25 and 26), namely A, B, C, and σintr. On the
other hand, to analyse wcg we assumed the gt posteriors on these
parameters as priors. A flat prior is used for the amplitude of the
log c200m − log M200m relation (Eq. 32). In the latter relation, we
fixed cM = −0.107 and cz = −1.16 (following Duffy et al. 2008).
We expect that our priors on σintr and c200m account for theoreti-
cal uncertainties in baryonic effects on cluster profiles (Schaller
et al. 2015; Henson et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2018; Beltz-Mohrmann
& Berlind 2021; Shao & Anbajagane 2024).

In the wcg modelling, we assumed flat priors on bg,0, bg,λ∗ ,
and bg,z, which enter the relation between the average galaxy
ob, ∆zob)⟩, and cluster observables (Eq. 29). The BHMF
bias, ⟨bg(∆λ∗
factor in Eq. (22) provides a correction to the standard Tinker
et al. (2008) halo mass function. For the parameters s and q,
we employed the Costanzi et al. (2019) prescription, assigning
a bivariate Gaussian prior with mean values (0.037, 1.008) and
covariance matrix CHMF expressed as

Although baryonic physics uncertainties are not taken into ac-
count in this prescription, they are negligible compared to the
precision of the BHMF measurement (see Costanzi et al. 2019, and
references therein).

5. Results
In the modelling presented here, we adopted a flat ΛCDM cos-
mological model assuming the median values of the posteriors
derived by L25, namely Ωm = 0.22 and σ8 = 0.86. The other
cosmological parameters were fixed to the results by Planck Col-
laboration et al. (2020, Table 2, TT, TE + EE + lowE + lens-
ing, referred to as Planck18 hereafter). Figure 2 shows the gt
and wcg measurements against the corresponding best-fit models.
The ⟨rsp⟩ estimates are shown as vertical bands, and are derived
by computing the model described in Sect. 4.5 at each MCMC
step. The results presented in this section on splashback radii,
masses, and other derived quantities are reported also in Table
1. The robustness of the results against our modelling choices is
discussed in Appendix C.

The top-left panel of Fig. 3 displays our constraints on
⟨Rsp⟩ ≡ ⟨rsp/r200m⟩, based on the methods outlined in Sect. 4.5.
Specifically, we first obtained the posteriors on ⟨Rsp⟩ and ⟨ν200m⟩
in each stack using Eq. (34), and then constrained Asp and Bsp
in Eq. (33) through an MCMC algorithm. In this process, we
ignored the statistical uncertainty on ⟨ν200m⟩, corresponding to
about 2%. We obtained the following constraints:

where the gt and wcg superscripts represent the results derived
from the modelling of weak-lensing and cluster-galaxy correla-
tion function measurements, respectively. As we can see in the
top-left panel of Fig. 3, our estimates of Rsp derived from these
two probes are consistent within 1σ. This agreement between the
two probes is in line with the findings of previous studies (Chang
et al. 2018; Shin et al. 2021). Furthermore, as reported in Table
1, we find no significant trends of Rsp with redshift or intrinsic
richness, indicating that rsp and r200m share similar dependencies
on M200m and z, in agreement with simulation predictions (More
et al. 2015; Diemer 2020a).

Compared to the Rsp constraints from Giocoli et al. (2024)
shown in Fig. 3, based on weak-lensing measurements in KiDS-
DR3, our gt modelling yields results that agree within 1σ for
ν200m > 3, reducing to 2σ agreement at lower ν200m. We verified
the consistency within 1σ between our rsp values and those from
Giocoli et al. (2024). Furthermore, our mass constraints agree
with those by L25 (see Appendix C). Thus, we conclude that
the observed small shift in Rsp aligns with the cluster mass dis-
crepancy between KiDS-1000 and KiDS-DR3 reported by L25.
In that work, the KiDS-1000 analysis yields lower masses at the
low-mass end. These lower masses imply smaller r200m values,
which in turn explain the larger Rsp we find compared to Giocoli
et al. (2024). L25 ascribe these mass differences to improved
systematic uncertainty modelling in KiDS-1000 (see Appendix
C in that reference). The modelling of wcg provides Rsp con-
straints in better agreement with Giocoli et al. (2024). As dis-
cussed below, this agreement originates mainly from the lower
rsp values derived from cluster-galaxy correlation function mea-
surements, which we attribute to dynamical friction. Indeed, gt
probes the total matter distribution and is insensitive to galaxy-
specific dynamical processes, while wcg traces the spatial dis-
tribution of satellite galaxies. Dynamical friction acts on these
satellites, causing them to lose kinetic energy and sink inward.
This shifts the splashback radius traced by wcg to smaller values.
The precision of the Rsp −ν200m relation parameters, reported
in Eq. (44), aligns with the findings of Giocoli et al. (2024). Our
analysis, however, incorporates a more comprehensive marginal-
isation over statistical uncertainties, including those from the
transition factor parameters (Eq. 9), the halo miscentring (Sect.
4.2), the intrinsic scatter of the log λ∗ − log M200m relation (Eq.
25), and the halo mass function correction (Eqs. 22 and 43). We
also applied more conservative λ∗ cuts.

The Rsp models in the top-left panel of Fig. 3 are com-
puted across the mass range of our sample, M200m ∈ [0.4, 20]
1014h−1M⊙, which is derived from individual cluster mass esti-
mates based on Eq. (54) in L25 and on the parameter posteriors
obtained from the gt modelling (Table 2). The theoretical models
shown in the figure, by More et al. (2015) and Diemer (2020a),
are computed at z = 0.45, which corresponds to the midpoint of
the redshift range covered by our cluster sample. We remark that
the redshift dependence of these models is very mild. Our con-
straints are in good agreement with these theoretical predictions.
The largest deviations appear for the wcg results at ν200m < 3,
reaching 2σ with Diemer (2020a) at ν200m ∼ 2.

The top-left panel of Fig. 3 also shows the comparison with
literature results based on X-ray (Umetsu & Diemer 2017; Con-
tigiani et al. 2019; Bianconi et al. 2021; Rana et al. 2023; Joshi
et al. 2025), Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ, Zürcher & More 2019;

strong lensing (SL), luminosity distribution (LD), and galaxy distribution (GD), are reported in the legend. Mass accretion rates from gt and wcg
measurements are shown in the middle and bottom panels, respectively. Here, the model by Diemer (2020a) is shown, computed at z = 0.2 (solid

galaxy clusters.3 We find general agreement with these litera-
ture results. The largest discrepancies arise against the results
by More et al. (2016) and Chang et al. (2018), based on cluster
member galaxy distributions. This may be explained in part by
dynamical friction, which has a greater effect on the galaxy sam-

ples used in those studies. In fact, More et al. (2016) and Chang
et al. (2018) used shallower galaxy samples, with a magnitude
limit of i < 21.5. Compared to our work, this implies a selection
of more massive galaxies, for which the impact of dynamical
friction is stronger. Future photometric surveys will allow for a
detailed investigation of the effects by dynamical friction.

As displayed in the top and middle panels of Fig. 4, the pre-
cision on Rsp and rsp derived from the modelling of gt and wcg
is constant with z and M200m. It amounts to 14% for gt and to
10% for wcg. These precisions are among the best available in
the literature to date. Furthermore, these results show that wcg
is a stronger probe of the splashback radius, as it directly con-
strains the infalling term parameters, which are not accessible
via weak-lensing observations (see Appendix D).

The right panels of Fig. 3 show that rsp estimates from wcg
are systematically lower than those from the gt modelling, al-

(Saro et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2019; Yan et al. 2020; Seppi et al.
2023; Sommer et al. 2024). As shown in Table 2, we constrain

modelling, obtaining bg,0 = 1.17+0.18

bg,z = 0.31+0.35
−0.33. A positive redshift evolution of ⟨bg⟩ is expected,
because galaxies at higher redshifts reside in rarer, more biased
haloes. Our analysis, however, does not yield a significant red-
shift trend, as bg,z is consistent with zero within 1σ. Similarly,
we find no significant dependence on λ∗. Future, more precise
wcg measurements will allow for a more detailed modelling of
the galaxy bias.

6. Discussion and conclusions

In this paper, we presented an analysis of the splashback radius
for the richest 8730 optically-selected galaxy clusters from the
AMICO KiDS-1000 catalogue (Maturi et al. 2025). The sample
covers an effective area of 839 deg2 and spans the redshift range
z ∈ [0.1, 0.8]. We measured and modelled the reduced tangential
shear, gt, and the cluster-galaxy projected correlation function,
wcg, of cluster ensembles, binning in redshift and mass proxy.
Our modelling strategy, based on the techniques employed in
recent cosmological analyses, allowed us to reconstruct the av-
erage properties of the underlying dark matter halo population,
such as the normalised splashback radius, Rsp, the splashback
radius, rsp, and the mass accretion rate, Γ.

Our constraints confirm the results of ΛCDM simulations
and agree with observational studies in the literature. The rsp
estimates from gt and wcg agree within 1σ, though wcg yields
slightly lower values. This small offset may reflect a mild dy-
namical friction effect on satellite galaxies. We caution that
galaxy selection is expected to play a role, as dynamical friction
preferentially affects the most massive cluster members. Further-
more, the precision of our rsp estimates is among the best avail-
able in the literature to date. It amounts to 14% in the case of
gt modelling, while wcg constraints have a precision 10%. The
measurements of wcg also uniquely constrain the profile of the
infalling material, which is not probed by weak-lensing observa-
tions.

A natural question is whether gt and wcg estimates of rsp
should be combined into a single constraint. We have chosen not
to do so because the two probes are physically distinct: gt traces
the total matter distribution, whereas wcg is sensitive to cluster
member galaxies, which are affected by dynamical friction. The
observed difference between the two measurements is consistent
with this expected bias. Combining them would therefore aver-
age a biased and an unbiased estimate of rsp. Future analyses
with more complete galaxy samples or explicit modelling of dy-
namical friction may allow for a joint rsp constraint.

As discussed in Sect. 4.6, we assumed that the net effect of
orientation and projections on the wcg measurements is absorbed
by the free galaxy bias. The impact of this assumption on wcg
will be tested in future studies based on simulations. Intrinsic
alignments are expected to have a negligible impact in our anal-
ysis, contributing only a sub-percent systematic error to cluster
profiles (Chisari et al. 2014; Sereno et al. 2018). In the mod-
elling of gt, L25 demonstrated that anisotropic boosts, affecting
the correlation functions on large scales due to optical projec-
tion effects (Sunayama et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2022; Sunayama
2023; Park et al. 2023; Zhou et al. 2024; Nyarko Nde et al.
2025), have negligible impact on our mass constraints. In par-
ticular, L25 adopted a model designed for cluster samples se-

though the values remain consistent within 1σ. This small offset
can be attributed to dynamical friction affecting cluster members
(Diemer et al. 2017; Chang et al. 2018), which also causes haloes
to appear more concentrated. Figure 3 displays also an agree-
ment on the M200m constraints derived from the two probes. As
we detail in Appendix D, the larger M200m uncertainties derived
from wcg, displayed in the bottom panels of Fig. 4, are attributed
to the differences in the constraints on the A and σintr parameters,
appearing in the log λ∗ − log M200m relation. The right panels of
Fig. 3 also show that rsp mildly decreases with redshift, as higher
redshifts correspond to larger halo mass accretion rates, leading
to smaller splashback radii (Diemer & Kravtsov 2014; Diemer
et al. 2017).

More et al. (2015) derived the following expression for the

dimensionless mass accretion rate, Γ,

where a is the scale factor. We computed Γ posteriors by in-
jecting ⟨Rsp(∆λ∗
ob, ∆zob)⟩ values, derived from Eq. (34) at each
MCMC step, into Eq. (45). Furthermore, Ωm(z) in Eq. (45) is
computed at the median cluster redshifts reported in Table 1. As
shown in the middle and bottom left panels of Fig. 3, our con-
straints on Γgt and Γwcg , derived from the modelling of gt and
wcg, respectively, agree with the theoretical model by Diemer
(2020a). This agreement is expected, as our Rsp results are con-
sistent with the ΛCDM predictions from More et al. (2015) and
Diemer (2020a), and Eq. (45) is itself derived from those same
simulations.

As reported in Table 2 and detailed in Appendix D, the wcg
modelling yields robust constraints on the DK14 infalling term
parameters, namely be and se, while weak-lensing observations
do not probe this region. This is not attributable to different mea-
surement precisions, which are similar for the two probes, but to
the fact that wcg is more directly sensitive to the spatial matter
distribution in the infall region. Weak lensing, instead, probes
∆Σt, an enclosed-mass quantity that is less sensitive to the de-
tailed structure of the infalling region. Further discussions on the
constraints on DK14 parameters can be found in Appendix D. In
agreement with L25, we find that the foff posterior aligns with
the prior and σoff = 0.21 ± 0.11 h−1Mpc. The latter constraint

lected with the red-sequence Matched-filter Probabilistic Perco-
lation (redMaPPer, Rykoff et al. 2014) algorithm. This approxi-
mation holds in the case of a cosmological two-halo term, which
mildly depends on the free parameters considered in the analy-
sis. In this work, the cosmological two-halo is replaced by a free
infalling term (Eq. 10), whose shape is poorly constrained by
weak-lensing observations. Thus, we do not expect a dramatic
impact of the anisotropic boosts on the results from the gt mod-
elling. Nonetheless, the constraints obtained from wcg measure-
ments may be biased due to this selection effect. In the future we
will effectively test the impact of this selection bias on rsp, de-
veloping dedicated mock data sets that simulate AMICO detec-
tions. We will also test how the assumption of the Diemer (2025)
model, adopted as an alternative to the DK14 profile (Eq. 8), af-
fects our results. The Diemer (2025) model requires higher data
quality because it includes a larger number of free parameters
compared to DK14, and KiDS-Legacy data (Wright et al. 2024)
can provide the statistical power needed to constrain these addi-
tional degrees of freedom. We also note that the DK14 model is
extrapolated up to very large scales for the derivation of gt (Eq.
16) and wcg (Eq. 17) models. The impact of such extrapolation
shall be assessed through simulations.

Based on simulations, Shin & Diemer (2023) demonstrated
the luminosity difference between the brightest cluster
that
galaxy and its brightest satellites, known as magnitude gap,
serves as a reliable tracer of both the mass accretion rate and
rsp. This gap widens as satellites undergo disruption and halo
accretion slows, also representing an indicator of system age
(Jones et al. 2003; Deason et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2025). Data
from KiDS-Legacy and Stage-IV surveys, such as Euclid (Eu-
clid Collaboration et al. 2025) and the Vera C. Rubin Obser-
vatory (Rubin/LSST, Ivezic et al. 2008), will allow us to em-
pirically constrain the correlation between rsp and the magni-
tude gap. Stage-IV data can potentially shed light also on the
stellar splashback radius, traced by the intracluster light (Da-
cunha et al. 2025; Walker et al. 2025), and on eventual devia-
tions from General Relativity probed by the outskirst of galaxy
clusters (Contigiani et al. 2023; Butt et al. 2025). As discussed
in Appendix C, rsp estimates obtained assuming the Planck18
cosmology are systematically lower than those from the base-
line analysis, though they remain consistent within 0.5σ. With
future data, the reduction in statistical uncertainties will enhance
the rsp sensitivity to cosmological parameters. Lastly, while the
present rsp measurements from gt and wcg are consistent within
1σ, upcoming data may better constrain the role of dynamical
friction on cluster galaxies.

Appendix A: Halo miscentring model

To model the contribution due to the miscentred population of
clusters, we assumed that the probability of a lens being at a pro-
jected distance Rs from the chosen centre, namely P(Rs), follows
a Rayleigh distribution (following, e.g. Johnston et al. 2007; Vi-
ola et al. 2015), that is

P(Rs) = Rs

where σoff is the standard deviation of the halo misplacement
distribution on the plane of the sky, expressed in units of h−1Mpc.
The corresponding azimuthally averaged profile is given by

where Σcen is the centred surface mass density, while θ is the
polar angle in the plane of the sky. The surface mass density
distribution of a miscentred halo is expressed as

where we write ⟨∆ρ(r | x)⟩x as ∆ρ(r) for brevity. If galaxies are
taken as biased tracers of the matter field, with galaxy overden-
sity δg ≡ bgδm and galaxy bias bg, the corresponding cluster-
galaxy correlation function follows from Eqs. (B.2) – (B.4):

ξcg(r) = bg

∆ρ(r)
ρm

.

(B.5)

Here, bg generally depends on the scale r. However, as discussed
below, we assumed a constant galaxy bias. The cluster-galaxy
correlation function projected over the line of sight, wcg, is ex-
pressed as follows:

wcg(R) =

(B.6)

where R is the projected comoving distance from the cluster cen-
tre, ˜n(χ) is the probability density function of galaxy comoving
distances, and χc is the comoving distance of the cluster. We re-
mark that χ and χc are comoving distances along the line of sight.
Alternatively, Eq. B.6 can be integrated over the galaxy redshift,
zg:

shear, gt,off, has the following expression:

gt,off(R, M, z) =

crit(z)⟩
crit(z)⟩−1 ⟨Σ−2

(A.4)

where Σoff is given by Eq. (A.3), while ∆Σt,off is derived by re-
placing Σ with Σoff in Eq. (14).

Appendix B: Cluster-galaxy correlation model

The 3D halo-matter correlation function, ξhm(r), is defined as
follows

ξhm(r) ≡ ⟨δh(x) δm(x + r)⟩x ,

(B.1)

where x denotes the 3D comoving position of a halo centre, δh
and δm are the halo and matter overdensity fields, respectively,
while ⟨. . . ⟩x represents the average over halo positions. The mat-
ter density field is defined as

δm(x) ≡

ρ(x) − ρm
ρm

,

(B.2)

where ρ is the local 3D matter density field and ρm is the mean
matter density of the Universe. Because the right-hand side of
Eq. (B.1) involves an average over halo centres, it can be ex-
pressed in terms of the conditional matter density profile around
haloes, ρ(r | x):

ξhm(r) =

⟨ρ(r | x) − ρm⟩x
ρm

=

⟨∆ρ(r | x)⟩x
ρm

.

(B.3)

Here, ⟨∆ρ⟩ can be expressed as the DK14 profile in Eq. (8). As-
suming spatial isotropy, the correlation function depends only
on the separation r = |r|. Furthermore, assuming that δc = δh,
where δc is the galaxy cluster density field, we can express the
3D cluster-matter correlation function as

ξcm(r) =

∆ρ(r)
ρm

,

(B.4)

where n(zg) is the galaxy redshift probability density function.
In Eq. (B.7), the Jacobian arising from the change of variable is
absorbed into the definition of n(zg), namely

n(zg) ≡ ˜n(χ(zg))

dχ
dzg

.

(B.8)

Substituting Eq. (B.5) into Eq. (B.7), we obtain

R2 + [χ(zg) − χc]2

(B.9)

where ⟨bg⟩ is the galaxy bias averaged along the line of sight.
With this approximation, we assume that bg varies slowly along
the line of sight, and that bg does not depend on the projected
separation R. These assumptions are motivated by the limited
constraining power of our data on bg.

Throughout this section, we assumed that x, r, and R are co-
moving distances. Conversely, in our analysis we measured and
modelled wcg as a function of the physical projected separation
from cluster centres. In this case, Eq. (B.9) takes the following
form:

wcg(R, z) =

⟨bg(z)⟩

where z is the cluster redshift. The (1 + z) factor in the denom-

epoch of the cluster.

Appendix C: Robustness of the results

In this work, parameters that cannot be fully constrained by our
data are fixed using simulations and previous observational re-
sults, as described in Sect. 4.6. Moreover, our sample selections
are driven exclusively by the quality of the fit. For instance, we
exclude clusters at z > 0.8 since their inclusion would otherwise

68% confidence of the models, while the dashed lines display median
values. The black solid line shows the model by Duffy et al. (2008). The
cluster redshift assumed in this figure is z = 0.45.

(see e.g. Duffy et al. 2008; Bhattacharya et al. 2013; Diemer
& Kravtsov 2015). Given our data set, this scatter is negligible
compared to the statistical uncertainty on the amplitude of the
relation, log c0.

Figure C.1 displays the comparison between the individual
cluster mass estimates derived from the gt modelling presented
in this work (based on Eq. 54 in L25) and those from L25. De-
spite L25 adopting the truncated NFW profile by Baltz, Mar-
shall, & Oguri (2009, BMO) rather than the DK14 profile in Eq.
(8), and modelling the gt profiles only up to 3.5 h−1Mpc, we find
excellent agreement.

As discussed in Sect. 5, in our analysis we assumed the me-
dian cosmological parameter values constrained by L25. To test
the impact of this choice, we fixed the cosmological parame-
ters to the median values from Planck18. The resulting splash-
back radius estimates obtained from the gt modelling are sys-
tematically lower but consistent within 0.5σ (Fig. C.2). These
lower rsp estimates are expected, as the Ωm value from Planck18,
Ωm = 0.31, is larger than the one assumed in our baseline analy-
sis, analysis, namely Ωm = 0.22. Indeed, larger Ωm implies faster
accretion rates and smaller rsp (Diemer et al. 2017; Haggar et al.
2024; Mpetha et al. 2024). We verified that the same level of
agreement holds for Rsp. While this test was performed only for
gt modelling, we expect similar results for wcg.

reduce the fit accuracy. In this section, we assess the impact of
these assumptions on our final results.

Several tests were already performed in L25, who carried out
the weak-lensing mass calibration of the cluster sample anal-
ysed in this paper. They showed that weak-lensing measure-
ments pass null tests, further demonstrating that the final mass
constraints are robust against the choice of priors on the halo
miscentring parameters. The same analysis also confirmed that
our data lack the precision to detect any potential mass depen-
dence of σintr. In addition, L25 demonstrated that fixing the mass
slope of the log c200m − log M200m relation (Eq. 32), denoted as
cM and discussed in Sect. 4.6, does not introduce any biases in
the mass estimates. The same holds for the intrinsic scatter in
the log c200m − log M200m relation, which amounts to about 35%

Fig. C.5. Constraints on the parameters of the transition factor and infalling term of the DK14 profile. The 68% and 84% confidence levels of the
2-dimensional posteriors from gt (blue) and wcg (orange) modellings are shown. The Gaussian priors on Ft, β, and γ0 are represented by the red
dashed lines.

Appendix D: Constraints on the DK14 parameters

In this work, we first estimated the parameters of the log λ∗ −
log M200m relation (Eq. 25) by modelling gt, subsequently using
the resulting posteriors as priors for the wcg modelling. Figure
C.3 shows that the two probes yield similar constraints on these
parameters. The most significant differences appear in the pos-
teriors for the amplitude, A, and the intrinsic scatter, σintr. For
wcg, the A posterior is shifted to lower values and is more heav-
ily tailed, while σintr peaks at a larger value compared to the
constraint from gt. The σintr result can be explained by our as-
sumption of M200m ≡ Mgt ≡ Mwcg , where Mgt and Mwcg are the
weak-lensing and cluster-galaxy correlation function masses, re-
spectively. In fact, these are scattered proxies of the true M200m
(see, e.g. Sereno & Ettori 2015b), with a larger scatter expected
for Mwcg due to the large variance in cluster member galaxy dis-
tributions. The differences in A and σintr explain the larger sta-
tistical uncertainties on Mwcg compared to Mgt (Fig. 4).

Figure C.4 shows that our constraints on the log c200m −
log M200m relation agree within 1σ with the model by Duffy et al.
(2008). The rsp results presented in Sect. 5 suggest that dynam-
ical friction on cluster member galaxies imprints a splashback

feature in wcg at smaller scales than in weak-lensing observa-
tions. Consequently, haloes traced by cluster galaxies should ap-
pear more concentrated. However, the large uncertainty on c200m
derived from wcg (Fig. C.4) precludes any stronger conclusion
on this point.

Figure C.5 shows that the constraints on the parameters of
the DK14 transition factor (Eq. 9), namely Ft, β, and γ0, align
with the adopted Gaussian priors. The largest difference between
prior and posterior occurs for β in the wcg modelling, where the
posterior median shifts from the prior by 0.5σ (see also Table
2). Furthermore, in this work we adopted uninformative priors
on the infalling profile parameters in Eq. (10), namely be and se,
allowing be to evolve with redshift (Eq. 11). As shown in Fig.
C.5 and reported in Table 2, gt measurements do not constrain
these parameters, whereas wcg provides strong constraints with a
precision of 11% on be,0 and of 4% on se. Our resulting values,
be,0 = 1.97+0.23
−0.046, also agree within 1σ with
the theoretical predictions from DK14. Neither probe constrains
the redshift evolution of be.
