We also continue to work toward\\nour 2030 interim financed emissions targets, with\\nthe goal of reaching net-zero financed emissions by\\n2050. By working with our clients on their climate\\ntransition plans, we can help achieve real-world\\ndecarbonization. Additionally, we continue to make\\nour own operations more sustainable by reducing our\\nemissions, using renewable energy and buying offsets\\nfor our operational emissions, and by incorporating\\nthe physical and transition risks of climate into the\\nfirm\\'s risk management and governance processes.\\nFurthermore, climate change is interconnected to the\\nthemes of biodiversity and natural capital, which have\\nbecome more in focus in recent years. In addition\\nto supporting our clients with commercial solutions\\n(as described in the Sustainable Finance section), we\\nmanage biodiversity and nature-related risks at the\\nfirm level (see our Environmental and Social Policy\\nStatement (ESPS). Throughout 2023, we engaged\\nour clients and stakeholders on these topics through\\nthought leadership, client events and a collaboration\\nwith the Natural Capital Project at Stanford University\\nto develop a new, open-source ecosystem services\\nfoot-printing tool.\\nGovernance and Risk Management: Strong\\ngovernance and risk management is critical to\\nthe long-term success and sustainability of the\\nfirm and helps create trust among our clients and\\nstakeholders. The Board of Directors (the \"Board\")\\nhas overall oversight of sustainability matters, with\\nregular updates provided to the Board\\'s Governance\\nand Sustainability Committee. Our ESPS provides\\na framework for evaluating potential transactions\\nto help ensure we are appropriately assessing\\nenvironmental and social risks. We continue to\\ndevelop our ESPS, and this year, have incorporated\\nadditional considerations relating to methane\\nabatement, human rights and a just climate transition.\\nIn 2021, Morgan Stanley set a goal to mobilize\\n$1 trillion for sustainable solutions by 2030, including\\n$750 billion toward low-carbon and green solutions.\\nWe have made significant progress, having now\\nachieved over $820 billion. Morgan Stanley\\'s\\nthree business segments-Institutional Securities,\\nWealth Management and Investment Management-\\ncontribute to our sustainable finance target and\\nalso offer a broader range of sustainability-related\\nproducts and solutions to our clients.\\nOur ability to deliver an integrated firm allows us\\nto capture new opportunities that aim to bring\\npositive long-term results not only to our clients and\\nshareholders, but to the environment and society\\nat large. In order to do this, we need to ensure\\nthat relevant ESG topics are incorporated into our\\ncorporate policies, business activities and operations.\\nThere are various ESG topics that are important to\\nthe firm, with human capital, climate change and\\ngovernance being the three themes on which we\\nprimarily focus for the purposes of this report.\\nHuman Capital: Our human capital efforts are rooted\\nin our core values and are structured to enhance the\\nemployee and workplace experience. In doing so, we\\naim to ensure that we are supporting our teams to\\nbest deliver strategic advice, solutions and services\\nto our clients.

We\\nrecognize the importance of balancing the need to\\nquickly reduce GHG emissions with the realities of\\nthe social, economic and geopolitical landscape.\\nThe following principles inform how we approach\\nthe climate transition:\\n• Prioritize Real-World Decarbonization.\\nMorgan Stanley will focus on working with our clients\\nacross sectors as they develop decarbonization\\nplans that seek to reduce their own emissions\\nand thus contribute to decarbonizing the global\\neconomy. In some cases, lending to companies that\\nare transitioning may, for a period of time, result\\nin an increase in our financed emissions. However,\\nwe believe that this approach will ultimately\\nfacilitate the transition to a lower-carbon world.\\n• Support Our Clients. As a global leader in financial\\nservices, we will continue to develop and distribute\\ninnovative products and solutions that serve our\\nclients and help them achieve their climate-related\\nambitions. This includes mobilizing capital toward\\nlow-carbon solutions and providing clients with\\nclimate-focused thought leadership and research.\\n• Provide Transparency. Morgan Stanley will\\ncontinue to be transparent in communicating our\\nclimate change strategy and progress toward our\\nclimate ambitions to clients, shareholders and\\nother stakeholders.\\n• Deliver Strong Internal Governance. We will\\ncontinue to implement internal oversight, controls\\nand coordination to ensure a robust and consistent\\napproach to climate-related risks, opportunities,\\nactivities and commitments.\\nMorgan Stanley recognizes the potential for\\nclimate change to impact our clients, investments,\\noperations, employees, local communities and the\\nglobal economy. Effective action on climate change\\nwill require a broad transformation of sectors and\\neconomies, and careful management of the impacts\\non workers and communities. A complex and just\\ntransition to a low-carbon economy will require\\nincremental efforts by governments, businesses and\\nindividuals. We are pleased to contribute our expertise\\nto our clients in support of their own transitions.\\nMORGAN STANLEY | 2023 ESG REPORT\\n44\\nINTRODUCTION SUSTAINABLE FINANCE HUMAN CAPITAL CLIMATE GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT APPENDICES\\n\\nOur Climate\\nAmbitions\\nMobilize Capital Toward\\nLow-Carbon and Green\\nSolutions\\nAs a global financial services firm, we have an\\nimportant role to play in helping to direct capital\\ntoward low-carbon and green solutions. Working\\nwith clients to scale low-carbon opportunities is a\\nkey component of our $1 trillion sustainable finance\\ntarget, which includes $750 billion toward low-carbon\\nand green solutions by 2030. In line with this target,\\nwe work to provide capital toward clean energy,\\nclimate adaptation, carbon removal and reduction,\\namong other themes. See the Sustainable Finance\\nTarget section of this report for more information.\\nIn addition, each of our business segments has a\\nfocus on climate solutions for clients:\\n• Institutional Securities provides capital to\\ncompanies, including those that seek to drive\\nclimate solutions. Supporting low-carbon\\nsolutions that help reduce our clients\\' greenhouse\\ngas (GHG) footprints helps us to reduce our own\\nfinanced emissions and make progress toward our\\nnet-zero targets.\\n• Wealth Management has developed a Climate\\nAction Investing Toolkit that helps our Financial\\nAdvisors navigate the broad range of available\\nclimate action investing strategies, and engage\\nwith their clients on the risks and opportunities\\nof climate action investing.\\n• Investment Management provides clients with\\ninvestment solutions across asset classes that seek\\nalignment with their return objectives alongside\\ntheir sustainability preferences, including climate,\\nas appropriate. For example, see our feature of the\\nclimate-focused 1GT platform here.\\nStrive Toward Our Financed\\nEmissions Targets\\nWe remain focused on making progress toward our\\n2030 financed emissions targets by contributing to\\nreal-economy decarbonization efforts. We aim to\\nreduce our financed emissions by providing our clients\\nwith the advice and capital required to transform\\nbusiness models and reduce their own carbon\\nintensity.\\nWe recognize that the path toward our financed\\nemissions targets will not be a straight line. We will\\ncontinue to consider our clients\\' approaches to climate\\ntransition in our corporate portfolio lending decisions\\nbut, in some cases, lending to companies that are\\ntransitioning may result in temporary increases in\\nour financed emissions. We are also aware of the\\nunintended consequences of withdrawing financing\\nfrom transitioning clients and sectors too rapidly,\\nand the need to balance climate considerations with\\nreal-time energy security needs.\\nIn addition, it is important to note that our financed\\nemissions targets are premised on the global economy\\nlimiting warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels.\\nHowever, we must recognize that current policies,\\ntechnology adoption and consumption habits are\\nnot yet aligned with this outcome. Without sufficient\\nchange in the aforementioned factors in the coming\\nyears, our clients, and our firm, may not meet\\nnet-zero aligned targets.\\nThat said, we remain committed to engaging with\\nclients on climate transition strategies to help move\\nthe world to net-zero emissions by 2050. Critical\\nto this is providing our clients with advice and\\nsolutions related to low-carbon opportunities, which\\nour Institutional Securities business is focused on\\n(see more here).\\nWe have a number of processes to help us\\nmonitor our progress toward 2030 interim targets\\nincluding: 1) annual updates to our Climate Strategy\\nAssessment Framework (CSAF) profiles to reflect\\nincremental disclosures or additional business\\nactivity; 2) business unit reviews of corporate loans\\nwithin our interim target sectors, incorporating\\nfinanced emissions lending intensity (FELI) metrics\\nand CSAF profiles; and 3) periodic reports to the\\nmanagement-level Firm ESG Committee and, as\\nnecessary and appropriate, to the Board\\'s\\nGovernance and Sustainability Committee.\\nMORGAN STANLEY | 2023 ESG REPORT\\n45\\nINTRODUCTION SUSTAINABLE FINANCE HUMAN CAPITAL CLIMATE GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT APPENDICES\\n\\nClimate Strategy Assessment\\nFramework\\nMorgan Stanley\\'s proprietary CSAF provides us with\\na data-driven assessment of our clients\\' climate\\nstrategies, to help us better engage with our clients\\nand inform business decisions.\\nAs first outlined in our 2022 ESG Report, the CSAF\\nleverages data from public sources, and may\\nbe supplemented by discussions with clients, as\\nappropriate. We assess a range of quantitative and\\nqualitative factors, including clients\\' net-zero and\\ninterim targets, climate-related governance, actions\\ntaken toward meeting targets and GHG emissions\\nreduction goals. The CSAF ultimately classifies clients\\ninto one of six categories, including limited actions,\\ntransition-aligned and green.\\nAs expressed in our Guiding Principles, we are\\ncommitted to working with our clients to advance their\\ndecarbonization goals and strategies, no matter the\\ncurrent maturity of their climate approach. The CSAF\\nprovides a forward-looking perspective on transition\\nreadiness, which is additive to the measurement of a\\nclient\\'s current carbon intensity, as reflected in our\\nFELI metric. Together, CSAF and FELI provide a more\\nholistic view of our clients\\' transition progress and\\nhelp us have a more informed view on where we, and\\nour clients, are headed relative to our stated financed\\nemissions reduction targets.\\nIn 2023, we embedded the CSAF further into our business\\nactivities and risk management processes. The firm:\\n• Completed an initial CSAF profile for all corporate\\nlending portfolio clients in the interim 2030 target\\nsectors of Energy, Power and Auto Manufacturing,\\nsubject to data availability.\\n• Added CSAF to the list of several factors that\\ninform corporate client lending decisions, helping\\nus understand how each loan may affect progress\\ntoward our 2030 interim targets.\\n• Worked toward introducing CSAF for credit\\nevaluation purposes within the Energy, Power and\\nAuto Manufacturing sectors and informing credit\\nrating assessments.\\n• Began developing CSAF profiles for clients in\\nadditional high-carbon sectors in order to better\\ninform the firm\\'s broader climate-related risk\\nmanagement.\\n• Educated investment banking coverage officers\\nfor the sectors on the CSAF and how it can be\\nused within our business decisions.\\nIt is important to note that while the CSAF provides a\\nforward-looking view of a client\\'s climate strategy, it\\nreflects the current status of a client\\'s climate efforts,\\nmany of which are nascent. We expect companies\\nto continue to set climate-related targets, as well as\\nimprove disclosure on their strategies, particularly as\\nforthcoming regulations across many regions require\\nincremental climate-related disclosures.\\nIf a client does not have a fully developed climate plan\\ntoday, it does not mean that the client is not advancing\\ntoward a low-carbon future. Updating CSAF profiles\\nannually enables us to understand the ways in which\\nclients are evolving, as well as how the firm can help\\nthem with decarbonization-related solutions.\\nWe assessed the transition plans and climate\\ncommitments for all lending clients in our three\\ninterim target sectors (Auto Manufacturing, Energy\\nand Power), subject to data availability. Some key\\nhighlights from our assessments to date include:\\n• Approximately 80% of our total committed\\nfinancing to these sectors is tied to companies\\nthat we consider to have a medium or high-quality\\ntransition plan in place.\\n• More than half of our clients across these three\\nsectors have long-term operational (scopes 1\\nand 2) targets to reach net-zero by 2050, while\\napproximately two-thirds of our clients have\\nnear-term emissions-reduction targets.\\n• Over 60% of our Power clients have explicit\\ntargets to increase renewable generation capacity\\nand/or phase down (or eliminate) coal-fired\\ngeneration capacity.\\n• All of our Automobile Manufacturing clients have\\nplans to increase production of electric vehicles\\n(EVs), with many targeting to have >50% of global\\nsales from EVs by 2030 or sooner.\\n• Approximately half of our Energy clients have\\ntargets to reduce or nearly eliminate methane\\nemissions by 2030 or sooner.\\nCLIMATE STRATEGY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK (CSAF)\\nFor example:\\nNet-Zero Target and\\n2030 Targets\\nFor example:\\nBoard Oversight and Management\\nof Climate-Related Risks\\nFor example:\\nEmissions Performance,\\nCapital Expenditures\\nEMISSIONS REDUCTIONS\\nTARGETS\\nCLIMATE CHANGE RELATED-\\nGOVERNANCE\\nTRANSITION ACTIONS &\\nPROGRESS\\nHIGH\\nMEDIUM\\nLOW\\nMORGAN STANLEY | 2023 ESG REPORT\\n46\\nINTRODUCTION SUSTAINABLE FINANCE HUMAN CAPITAL CLIMATE GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT APPENDICES\\n\\nMaintain Carbon Neutral\\nOperations\\nMorgan Stanley is focused on the sustainability of\\nour operations, including maintaining our carbon\\nneutral status33 and 100% renewable electricity\\nthroughout 2023 with the following strategies:\\n• Securing renewable electricity through our virtual\\npower purchase agreement (VPPA), on-site solar\\narrays, unbundled green electricity tariffs, and\\nunbundled RECs.\\n• Purchasing carbon offsets to compensate for our\\nremaining operational emissions, in accordance\\nwith the following strategy:\\n• Our carbon offset portfolio follows a governance\\nprocess to help ensure quality and credibility.\\n• Our strategy prioritizes removing carbon from\\nthe atmosphere, with removal credits accounting\\nfor approximately 81% of our portfolio in 2023.\\n• Projects are certified by an internationally\\nrecognized carbon standard.\\n• We pursue projects that deliver benefits\\nsupporting the U.N.

For any given year the determination of carbon neutrality is based on the best available data at the time of such determination. This data and related\\nmethodologies are evolving and improving so that information for prior periods is subject to change and revision.\\n\\nCarbon neutral status is a management-determined metric that may be viewed or calculated differently by others who may use the same \"carbon neutral\" terminology. Morgan Stanley has determined that the boundary\\naround our carbon neutrality status is scope 1, scope 2 location-based emissions, scope 3 business travel and downstream leased assets, carbon offsets purchased from the voluntary carbon market, green power\\ncontracts, and market instruments (e.g., renewable energy certificates (RECs), energy attribute certificates (EACs)). There are instances where green power contracts and instruments that we accept for our purposes\\nto meet carbon neutrality do not align with the criteria required to reflect those purchases in our scope 2 market-based figure in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting\\nStandard (Revised Edition) (\"GHG Protocol\").

Firm Risk\\nManagement (FRM), in partnership with other areas of the firm, continues to focus on identifying and managing financial\\nrisks related to climate change in order to limit their potential impact to Morgan Stanley.\\nDefining Climate Risks\\nAs informed by the TCFD, as well as various\\nnon-governmental organizations and regulators,\\nMorgan Stanley categorizes the risks associated\\nwith climate change into two groups: transition risks\\nand physical risks. The timing, severity and impact\\nof these risks are difficult to predict at this time.\\nTransition Risks: Risks associated with the move\\nto a low-carbon economy generally fall into one of\\nthree categories:\\n1 Policy and legal changes, such as local, national\\nor international regulation of carbon emissions\\n2 Technology advancements, such as replacement\\nof existing products with lower-emission options\\n3 Market developments, such as changes in\\nconsumer and business sentiment or impacts\\nresulting from public perception of an\\norganization\\'s action or inaction on climate change\\nDepending on the nature, speed and breadth of these\\nchanges, transition risks may pose varying degrees\\nof financial, reputational, regulatory, compliance or\\nother risks to Morgan Stanley as well as our clients or\\nthird parties on which we rely. Negative impacts of\\ntransition risks on certain clients, such as decreased\\nprofitability or asset write-downs, could lead to\\nthe firm experiencing increased financial risks.\\nSuch increased financial risks could increase\\nour expenses and adversely impact our business\\nstrategies, including by limiting our ability to pursue\\ncertain activities or offer certain products and\\nservices.\\nPhysical Risks: The physical impacts of climate\\nchange include harm to people and property arising\\nfrom acute climate-related events such as hurricanes,\\nheatwaves, droughts, floods or wildfire, and chronic,\\nlonger-term shifts in climate patterns, such as\\nhigher average temperatures, rising sea levels and\\nlong-term droughts.

This framework is divided into four steps:\\nMorgan Stanley\\'s Risk Management Framework\\nRISK IDENTIFICATION\\nThe first step in managing climate risk requires\\ncorrect identification of the climate risks that may\\nimpact Morgan Stanley\\'s products, business lines\\nand physical footprint. As with other types of risk\\nidentification, climate risk identification is critical\\nto the measurement, monitoring and mitigation\\nof financial risks to Morgan Stanley.\\nMorgan Stanley monitors external developments\\nand tracks the latest science to understand the\\nclimate risks posed to the firm. FRM continues to\\nevolve its centralized risk identification inventory\\nto identify appropriate climate-related risks.\\nManaging Climate Risks\\nMorgan Stanley continues to expand its capabilities\\nfor identifying and managing the risks associated\\nwith climate change. To that end, FRM is responsible\\nfor overseeing the management of Morgan Stanley\\'s\\nclimate-related financial risks. FRM\\'s Central\\nClimate Risk team is responsible for working with\\nstakeholders in FRM and across the firm to identify,\\nmonitor, mitigate and report on the climate-related\\nfinancial risks that the firm may face. Given the\\nglobal nature of climate risk, the Central Climate Risk\\nteam includes members in regions around the world\\nwhere Morgan Stanley has a significant presence,\\nincluding the Americas, EMEA and APAC.\\nMorgan Stanley views climate risk not as a stand-\\nalone risk type, but as an overarching risk that can\\nimpact other risk types, such as credit risk, market\\nrisk, operational risk and liquidity risk. As climate\\nrisk is interconnected with other risk types, we have\\ndeveloped and continue to enhance processes\\nto embed climate risk considerations into our risk\\nmanagement strategies and governance structures.\\nMorgan Stanley\\'s 2022 ESG Report describes the\\nrisk types overseen by FRM and the means by\\nwhich they may be impacted by climate risks\\n(see the \"Climate Risk Management\" section of\\nMorgan Stanley\\'s 2022 ESG Report).\\nMORGAN STANLEY | 2023 ESG REPORT\\n51\\nINTRODUCTION SUSTAINABLE FINANCE HUMAN CAPITAL CLIMATE GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT APPENDICES\\n\\nScenario Analysis\\nIn order to measure, manage and communicate\\nclimate risks, we leverage scenario analysis, which\\nutilizes a variety of approaches to identify potential\\nvulnerabilities in our business and to measure the\\nresulting impact.34 We leverage Morgan Stanley\\'s\\ninternal risk inventory and materiality assessments\\nto inform the design of our climate scenarios, which\\nemphasize either transition risk or physical risk.\\nMorgan Stanley continues to enhance its scenario\\nanalysis capabilities, with a focus on areas in which\\nthere is a greater degree of uncertainty as compared\\nto established stress testing frameworks, such as the\\nquality of forward-looking climate data and climate\\nscenario modeling over longer-term time horizons.\\nSuch uncertainties may be considered when using\\nscenario analysis in the risk management process,\\nand the firm will continue to update its scenario\\nanalysis processes as these data quality and\\nanalytical frameworks mature over time.\\nTRANSITION RISK SCENARIO ANALYSIS\\nTransition risk scenario analysis helps Morgan Stanley\\nunderstand how a transition to a low-carbon economy\\nmay create financial risks to the firm. Morgan Stanley\\nleverages regulatory scenarios and scenarios from\\nthe Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for\\nGreening the Financial System (NGFS) for guidance\\nand best practices when designing transition risk\\nscenarios. Transition risk scenarios are used to\\nanalyze the firm\\'s vulnerabilities, emerging changes\\nin policies (such as carbon pricing) and the potential\\neconomic impact of such policy changes. Scenarios\\nmay be conducted for different time horizons and\\nseverities, and consider exposure concentrations by\\nsector and industry.\\nTo conduct the analysis, FRM leverages existing\\neconomic scenario forecast models as a starting\\npoint to develop climate scenario forecasts. This\\napproach allows FRM to capture key macroeconomic\\nand financial market variables across regions and\\nsectors. Climate-specific variables are then taken\\nfrom widely recognized industry sources, such\\nas NGFS, or through input from Morgan Stanley\\nResearch. These variables are then incorporated\\ninto the macroeconomic scenarios.\\nPHYSICAL RISK SCENARIO ANALYSIS\\nPhysical risk scenario analysis helps Morgan Stanley\\nunderstand the potential impact that acute or chronic\\nweather events could have on our business. Physical\\nrisk scenarios leverage internal inputs and models,\\nand adjust them for climate-specific factors based\\non the scenario narrative. The scenarios in focus\\nmay be informed by the firm\\'s vulnerabilities or the\\noutcome of our risk identification process.\\nMorgan Stanley has analyzed the potential financial\\nconsequences of climate events of varying degrees\\nof impact, including acute events such as severe\\nweather. The portfolios in scope are generally\\nthose we have identified as having concentrations\\nin geographies impacted by the physical risk\\nbeing analyzed.\\nIn addition, Morgan Stanley\\'s Operational Risk\\nDepartment runs scenarios to assess and quantify\\npotential losses that Morgan Stanley\\'s operations\\nmay incur as a result of climate-related physical\\nrisks. Supported by Fusion Response, which\\nresearches the potential threats to operations, the\\nOperational Risk Department identifies and ranks\\nthe key physical risks for each of our main office\\nlocations.\\nThe physical risks are assessed in terms of damages\\nto Morgan Stanley\\'s physical assets as well as\\nincremental losses incurred to maintain operations.\\nAs part of the assessment, the scenarios consider\\nthe potential occurrence of severe weather events.\\nTIME HORIZONS FOR SCENARIO ANALYSIS\\nBoth transition and physical risks can materialize\\nover different time horizons. For example, episodic\\nextreme hurricanes present near-term physical\\nrisks to vulnerable regions and populations, while\\ntransition risk measures, such as carbon taxes,\\npresent longer-term challenges as economies adjust\\nto increased costs and market or technological\\nchanges stemming from the implementation of\\na potential tax on carbon. Institutions, such as\\nMorgan Stanley, therefore face the challenge of not\\nonly identifying climate risks to their business, but\\nalso analyzing the likely timing, duration and severity\\nof each physical and transition risk they face.\\nIdentify risks\\nDesign scenario\\nbased on\\nidentified risks\\nRun scenario\\nand analyze\\nresults\\n34 Unlike established scenario frameworks for other risk categories (e.g., credit, market, and liquidity risks), scenario analyses for climate risk, covering a much longer time period and including varying assumptions regarding\\nmitigation, are still developing as data quality and analytics are enhanced. While the outcome of a climate risk scenario may be helpful to show trends over time or as one input in the risk management process, such\\noutcomes continue to be inherently uncertain and not comparable among companies.\\nMORGAN STANLEY | 2023 ESG REPORT\\n52\\nINTRODUCTION SUSTAINABLE FINANCE HUMAN CAPITAL CLIMATE GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT APPENDICES\\n\\nClimate Risk Scores\\nFRM has developed climate-related scores to\\nassess the climate risk of sub-industries and\\ngeographies. The scores are used in a number\\nof climate risk management-related processes,\\nincluding risk identification, scenario analysis\\nand credit risk ratings.\\nWe categorize obligors and counterparties with\\nsimilar climate risk profiles into climate sub-\\nindustries. Each climate sub-industry is assigned\\na score for physical risk and transition risk using\\nclimate data from external vendors, such as\\nhistorical damage losses and emissions intensity.\\nClimate Risk Governance\\nWe maintain a governance process to regularly\\ncommunicate climate risk updates to key internal\\nstakeholders and committees. This process helps\\nensure appropriate oversight and transparency.\\nThe Climate Risk Committee (CRC) reports to the\\nFirm Risk Committee and subsequently the Board\\nRisk Committee, and oversees matters relating to\\nthe firm\\'s financial and nonfinancial exposure\\nto climate risk, including the integration of climate\\nrisk considerations into firm decision-making\\nand the firm\\'s exposure to physical and transition\\nclimate risk. The CRC oversees the FRM Climate\\nSteering Committee, which is responsible for\\nreviewing climate risk-related matters within FRM.\\nThe CRC also receives reports from a number of\\nbusiness unit and regional ESG committees on\\nclimate risk-related matters, as reflected in ESG\\nGovernance here.\\nMORGAN STANLEY | 2023 ESG REPORT\\n53\\nINTRODUCTION SUSTAINABLE FINANCE HUMAN CAPITAL CLIMATE GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT APPENDICES\\n\\nClimate Metrics and Targets\\nMetrics and targets are important to our climate strategy and help the firm track progress toward our climate-related goals.\\nPercent reduction in lending intensity metric compared to the 2019 base year\\n2030 Interim Financed Emissions Reduction Targets\\nFinanced Emissions\\n35,36\\nWe announced initial 2030 interim financed\\nemissions reduction targets in 2021.

We calculate AFE\\nrelated to relationship and event-driven loans for\\nthree sectors within our corporate lending portfolio.\\nWhere financing is provided to entities that are\\ndeveloping Power- or Energy-related projects, we\\ncalculate financed emissions once the project is\\noperational, and only for the operational emissions of\\nthose projects (i.e., we do not calculate the lifetime\\nemissions of the projects nor the development-\\nrelated emissions while the project is being built).\\nOur AFE includes all three emissions scopes of our\\nlending clients.\\nFigures are reported as gross, and do not account\\nfor any use of offsets or removals by clients.\\nPer PCAF methodology, we only calculate AFE on\\nloans that were drawn as of the last day of the\\nyear. Using drawn exposure amounts, rather than\\ncommitted exposure as used for our FELI-based\\ntargets, increases the variability of the metrics.\\nA small number of loans may not have financial\\ninformation available (for example, if the borrower\\nhas entered bankruptcy, or prior to operationalizing\\na project). For 2022, excluded loans represented 3%\\nof our lending on a total committed exposure basis.\\nThere are no additional exclusions from our calculated\\nAFE population based on data, materiality or other\\nmethodological issues.\\nAuto Manufacturing: For the Auto Manufacturing\\nsector portfolio, our AFE results demonstrate a\\nsubstantial increase in 2022. This is primarily due to\\na change in the composition of borrowers and the\\namount they have drawn on their facilities at year end.\\nEnergy: For the Energy sector portfolio, the total\\namount that companies have drawn on their facilities\\nincreased in 2022.\\nPower: For the Power sector portfolio, 2022 AFE\\nincreased slightly due to an increase in the total\\namount that companies in this portfolio have drawn\\nagainst their facilities.\\nMORGAN STANLEY | 2023 ESG REPORT\\n56\\nINTRODUCTION SUSTAINABLE FINANCE HUMAN CAPITAL CLIMATE GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT APPENDICES\\n\\nPCAF Data Quality Scores\\nMorgan Stanley\\'s calculation of data quality\\nscores for our financed emissions reporting is\\ninformed by the PCAF guidance, but also based on\\nthe methodology of our third-party data vendor.\\nThis includes use of third-party data inputs, and\\nsometimes requires estimates and assumptions\\nbased on the availability of data. These scores\\nindicate the quality of the source of the emissions\\ndata underlying our calculations, on a scale from 1\\nto 5, with 1 being the highest quality. For example,\\ncompany reported emissions are scored as higher\\ndata quality as they are specific and may be third-\\nparty verified, whereas economic activity-based\\nemissions factors, which are used to estimate\\ncompany emissions, are considered lower data\\nquality. PCAF guidance recommends calculating a\\ndata quality score for scopes 1 and 2 separate from\\na score for scope 3. For more information on the\\nPCAF methodology document.39\\nApplication of our third-party data vendor\\'s\\nmethodology may result in data quality scores which\\nare not reflective of all emissions data within any\\ngiven emissions scope. For example, if a company\\nreports emissions for just one single scope 3\\ncategory, the overall data quality score for scope 3\\nwould only reflect that data has been reported,\\ndespite emissions being estimated for other scope\\n3 categories. This results in a data quality score\\nthat may imply higher quality data than had the\\nestimation component also been considered.\\nMorgan Stanley does not guarantee the accuracy\\nof such information and methodologies as\\nstandards in this area continue to evolve and\\nmay change, which may also cause us to restate\\nprior-period data quality scores in the future.\\nThe data quality scores for FELI and AFE differ. This\\nis because FELI uses committed exposure and thus\\nincludes all clients within our lending portfolio,\\nwhereas the AFE metric only includes clients that\\nhave drawn exposure at year end.

Under this\\napproach, Morgan Stanley accounts for 100% of the\\nGHG emissions from operations over which it has\\noperational control. Morgan Stanley accounts for the\\nfirm\\'s proportional share of the emissions associated\\nwith outstanding relationship and event-driven client\\nlending facilities, for which the firm does not have\\noperational control, as absolute financed emissions\\n(AFE) within Scope 3, Category 15. The lending\\nfacilities included in our AFE calculation are limited to\\nthose within the Auto Manufacturing, Power, and\\nEnergy sectors within our corporate lending portfolio.\\nAs informed by the Business Loans asset class\\nguidance within the PCAF Global GHG Accounting\\nand Reporting Standard (2022), AFE related to these\\noutstanding facilities are attributed to Morgan Stanley\\non the basis of our share of lending relative to the\\nclient\\'s company value for public companies (i.e.\\nEnterprise Value Including Cash (EVIC) (based on our\\nthird-party vendor\\'s methodology)) or total company\\ndebt plus total company equity for private companies\\n(based on Morgan Stanley\\'s methodology), as\\napplicable, generally as of December 31 of each\\nreporting year. However, the client company\\nvalue inputs may not always be directly aligned to\\nDecember 31 of the reporting year and may vary\\nbased on the client data available as of the date\\nof our AFE calculation as well as based on the\\nmethodology of our third-party data vendor. For\\nexample, the number of clients\\' outstanding shares\\nutilized in the determination of EVIC represent the\\nmost current shares publicly available as of the\\nend of the reporting year (e.g. December 31, 2022),\\nwhich may differ from the actual outstanding shares\\nat that point in time. Furthermore, certain of our\\nclients have a fiscal year end which is different than\\nthe calendar year end used as our reporting period.\\nIn such instances, we utilize the information from\\nthe client\\'s most recent annual financial reporting\\nwithin our calculation without adjustment.\\nTotal Sector Lending CommitmentS\\n∑C\\n∑C\\nLending Outstanding AmountC\\nEnterprise Value including Cash (EVIC)C\\nLending CommitmentC\\nEnterprise Value including Cash (EVIC)C\\nx Annual GHG EmissionsC\\nx Annual GHG EmissionsC\\nMORGAN STANLEY | 2023 ESG REPORT\\n82\\nINTRODUCTION SUSTAINABLE FINANCE HUMAN CAPITAL CLIMATE GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT APPENDICES\\n\\nGreenhouse Gases\\nMorgan Stanley receives carbon emissions values\\nfor our clients from a third-party data vendor. The\\ndata vendor aggregates all constituent gases which\\nare reported by companies, which could include:\\nCO2 (Carbon Dioxide), CH4 (Methane), N2O (Nitrous\\nOxide), HFCs (Hydrofluorocarbons), PFCs, SF6, or\\nNF3. In instances where carbon emissions data is\\nnot provided by the companies nor by the data\\nvendor, carbon emissions are estimated using a\\nrevenue-based industry-specific carbon intensity\\nproxy. This proxy is derived by the data vendor on\\na CO2-equivalent emissions through application of\\nthe global warming potentials (GWPs) from the IPCC\\nFourth Assessment Report (AR4) to the non-carbon\\ngreenhouse gases. We thus report our AFE and\\nFELI metrics on a CO2-equivalent basis. Biogenic\\nemissions are not applicable to our financed\\nemissions calculations at this time.\\nRevision Policy\\nThere may be instances in which we identify\\nchanges to previously reported data due to\\nrestatements in third-party or client data, error\\ncorrections, or changes in our calculation\\nmethodology. We quantify the change to the\\nreported data metrics, and in accordance with\\nMorgan Stanley\\'s Financed Emissions Disclosure\\nRevision Policy, we will publicly revise the data\\npoint if the change is determined to be +/- 5% of\\ntotal reported Absolute Financed Emissions (AFE)\\nfor the reporting year, and may publicly revise if the\\nchange is determined to be +/- 5% of the reported\\nsector Financed Emissions Lending Intensity (FELI)\\nvalue for the reporting year.\\nBase Year\\nMorgan Stanley\\'s base year for its financed\\nemissions inventory is 2019, the earliest year for\\nwhich AFE and FELI were calculated and reported.\\nThe Revision Policy as outlined on this page, is\\napplicable to any potential calculation changes to\\nreported base year data.\\nData Limitations\\nThe use of client emissions data continues to have\\nsignificant limitations and challenges.

Under this\\napproach, Morgan Stanley accounts for 100% of\\nthe GHG emissions from operations over which it\\nhas operational control. This includes all owned or\\nleased facilities that the company occupies, and all\\nvehicles that the firm owns or leases and operates.\\nMorgan Stanley equity method investments, along\\nwith investment funds and other managed entities\\nand their respective portfolio companies and assets,\\nare excluded under this boundary.\\nMorgan Stanley\\'s base year for its GHG inventory\\nis 2012, the earliest year for which we had reliable\\ndata. The location-based results have been used as a\\nproxy to calculate scope 2 market-based emissions\\nfor the 2012 base year as the firm cannot calculate\\nmarket-based results for that year. Morgan Stanley\\nwill follow the guidelines in the Climate Leaders\\nGreenhouse Gas Inventory Protocol Design Principles\\n(US EPA, 2005) for adjusting the base year GHG\\ninventory. The base year inventory will be adjusted in\\nresponse to any structural or methodology changes\\nif the resulting adjustment is more than 5% of the\\nOperational Emissions\\' total base year emissions\\ndisclosed. Adjustments less than this threshold are\\nconsidered insignificant and will be decided case\\nby case.\\nOn an annual basis, Morgan Stanley calculates\\nthe firm\\'s GHG emissions inventory: CO2 (Carbon\\nDioxide), CH4 (Methane), N2O (Nitrous Oxide), HFCs\\n(Hydrofluorocarbons). The firm currently has no\\nemissions from PFCs, SF6, or NF3. Biogenic emissions\\nare not applicable to our business. Emissions of\\nnon-CO2 greenhouse gases are calculated as CO2-\\nequivalent emissions by applying the global warming\\npotential (GWPs) from the IPCC Fourth Assessment\\nReport (AR4), IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5),\\nand EPA Emissions Hub 2023 (2023).\\nGHG emissions are calculated using third-party\\nsoftware, with factors applied based on location\\nand emission source (see table below). There are\\nexceptions for some GHG emission calculations,\\nwhich are performed external to the third-party\\nsoftware, including scope 1 mobile combustion and\\nscope 3 category 6 (business travel) emission sources\\nand their related GHG emissions. Emission source\\nactivity and the related GHG emissions calculations\\nthat take place external to the third-party software\\nhave their results loaded into the software to maintain\\na single record of GHG emissions for all scopes.\\nIn most instances, the most up-to-date emission\\nquantification factors are sourced from international\\nand national environmental authorities across the\\nglobe (including but not limited to the International\\nEnergy Agency (IEA), United States Environmental\\nProtection Agency (EPA), United Kingdom Department\\nfor Environmental, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA), and\\nothers) and applied to respective regions.\\nWhere available, Morgan Stanley gathers actual\\nemission source activity data such as utility invoice\\ndata or local meter readings. In 2023, estimation\\nintensity factors were updated for both offices and\\ndata centers. For office facilities where activity data\\nis not available, Morgan Stanley estimates emissions\\nby adopting the method of energy use intensity\\nfactors developed from Commercial Buildings\\nEnergy Consumption Survey (CBECS), according\\nto building type and region. For data centers,\\nestimation intensity factors for Scope 2 emissions\\nare based on consumption of electricity to operate\\ninformation technology hardware using data center\\nfacility power usage effectiveness ratio. Landlord\\noverhead emissions at data centers were calculated\\nand determined to be Scope 3 Category 8 emissions,\\nwhich are not reported by Morgan Stanley.\\nScope 2 market-based emissions are calculated\\nincluding the impact from Renewable Energy\\nCertificates (RECs) from our Virtual Power Purchasing\\nAgreement (VPPA) and Energy Attribute Certificates\\n(EACs) from renewable power systems.\\nFor scope 3 category 6 (business travel) and scope 1\\nmobile combustion, data is collected from suppliers\\nand publicly available emission factors are used to\\nestimate emissions.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to\\nobtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to the subject matter\\nin order for it to be presented in accordance with the criteria. The procedures performed in a review vary\\nin nature and timing from and are substantially less in extent than an examination, the objective of which\\nis to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the subject matter is presented in accordance with the\\ncriteria, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an\\nopinion.

Actual results or actions may differ from anticipated\\ngoals, approaches and targets set forth in the forward-\\nlooking statements. These statements are not historical facts\\nor statements of current conditions, but instead are based\\non management\\'s current expectations and are subject to\\nuncertainty and changes in circumstances. These statements are\\nnot guarantees of future results or occurrences and involve certain\\nknown and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are\\ndifficult to predict and are often beyond our control. In addition,\\nthis report contains statements based on hypothetical scenarios\\nand assumptions, which may not occur or differ significantly\\nfrom actual events, and these statements should not necessarily\\nbe viewed as being representative of current or actual risk or\\nforecasts of expected risk.\\nActual results and financial conditions may differ materially from\\nthose included in these statements due to a variety of factors,\\nincluding, among others, data quality and availability, global\\nsocio-demographic, political and economic conditions and\\ntrends; energy prices; technological innovations; climate-related\\nconditions and weather events; counterparty and client behavior,\\nincluding the ability to reach climate targets and execute on\\ntransition plans, and financial health; the evolution of consumer\\nbehavior; insurance applicability, legislative and regulatory\\nchanges; the need for thoughtful climate policies, the challenge\\nof balancing short-term targets with the need to facilitate an\\norderly transition and energy security, our ability to retain and\\nattract qualified employees in a competitive environment for\\ntalent; the potential impact of legal and regulatory obligations;\\nand other unforeseen events or conditions, and the precautionary\\nstatements included in this report and those contained in\\nMorgan Stanley\\'s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange\\nCommission (SEC) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\\nas amended (Exchange Act). Certain forward-looking statements\\nincluded in this report are also based on assumptions, standards,\\nmetrics, methodologies and frameworks for measurement,\\nreporting and analysis of climate change that continue to evolve,\\nvary across jurisdictions and regulatory bodies and are the\\nsubject of proposed regulatory changes in multiple jurisdictions,\\nwhich may have a material impact on our future measurement\\nand reporting, as well as the results of the efforts set forth in this\\nreport.

Our approaches to the disclosures included in\\nthis report differ in significant ways from those included in\\nmandatory regulatory reporting, including under SEC rules and\\nregulations.\\nInformation within this report may be presented from a different\\nperspective or in more detail than disclosures mandated by our\\nglobal regulators. In particular, while the foregoing discussion\\ndescribes potential future events that may be significant or\\nmaterial (based on disclosure recommendations and broader\\ndefinitions of materiality used by certain voluntary external\\nframeworks and reporting guidelines or those in non-U.S.\\njurisdictions), the significance or materiality of those potential\\nevents should not be read as equating to or arising to the level\\nof materiality as required under U.S. federal securities laws,\\nincluding as the concept is used in Morgan Stanley\\'s periodic\\nfilings with the SEC under the Exchange Act. In addition, any\\ndiscussion of forward-looking statements in this report is\\nnot an indication that the subject or information is material to\\nMorgan Stanley for U.S. federal securities laws and regulations\\nreporting purposes. We continue to monitor the climate\\ndisclosure landscape and evolve our reporting accordingly.\\nUSE OF THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION AND ESTIMATES\\nNo reports, documents or websites that are cited or referred\\nto in this report shall be deemed to form part of this report.\\nIn addition, certain information contained in this report has\\nbeen derived from publicly available information released\\nby third-party sources, which Morgan Stanley believes to be\\nreasonable, although Morgan Stanley has only been able to\\ncomplete limited validation. Third-party climate information\\nmay not reflect the latest or most accurate data. To the extent\\nthat such third-party information we use is subsequently\\ndetermined to be erroneous or otherwise not in keeping with\\nbest practices, it may affect our disclosures. Additionally, in the\\nabsence of company-specific emissions data, some financed\\nemissions will be estimated using emissions and activity factors\\nprovided by third-party sources or derived by Morgan Stanley.\\nCertain third-party information, such as scope 3 emissions and\\nemissions factors, may change over time as methodologies\\nevolve and are refined or current data changes or is restated or\\nnew data is added. Our ability to measure progress toward our\\ntargets, goals, aspirations or objectives is subject to the quality\\nand availability of such data, as discussed in this report. These\\nand other factors could cause results to differ materially from\\nthose expressed in the estimates and beliefs made by third\\nparties and by Morgan Stanley.\\nGiven the inherent uncertainty of the estimates, assumptions\\nand timelines contained in this report, we may not be able\\nto anticipate whether or the degree to which we will be able\\nto meet our plans, targets, goals, aspirations or objectives\\nin advance.
